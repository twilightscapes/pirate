question: Can you clean with our dogs in the yard?
---
Our team loves dogs and would be happy to clean your property with them

outside as long as they are friendly and allow us to do our job unimpeded. If

they arenâ€™t as friendly or simply make our job more difficult, we would prefer

if you kept them inside until our services are complete.

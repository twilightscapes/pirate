# PIRATE

PIRATE is not your typical social network. It's a decentralized network of individualy owned personal websites acting together as a new social content distribution model. 

Here's how it works: instead of relying on a central platform, PIRATE leverages the power of Netlify and GitHub to utelize their free services for hosting your own platorm.  Your individual website becomes your hub for social interactions on both PIRATE and other social media. The content you produce, you fully own and control the rights to.

More than just a collection of individual websites, PIRATE uses the magic of RSS feeds, you can enjoy a central timeline that aggregates posts from across the network. You get to see what others are sharing, discover new voices, and engage in meaningful conversations.

Your PIRATE website is actually a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means you can access it seamlessly from any of your devices. Being a PWA also means there are no App Stores to worry about! 

PIRATE gives you the tools to easily edit your homepage, update your profile, and publish engaging posts. It's super easy to get started, without any complicated technical barriers. 

## But wait, there is more...

PIRATE is ALSO:

A complete website/web app platform with multimedia blog, that you can use however you wish. Configurable through the built in Content Management System, PIRATE comes with a customizable profile page and timeline. It also comes with a custom resume, cover letter and skills and notes pages with integrated contact forms that send directly to any email address.

Basically, PIRATE enables you to have YOUR OWN space on the web, where you can be confident that the content you produce is FULLY in your control. Twitter and other social media sites may change or come and go. With PIRATE, that doesn't matter - your content you share, is ALWAYS under your control. 

PIRATE is built to operate using FREE Cloud Based Services. This means that your PIRATE account is basically free to operate month to month with no cost. You only pay a metered cost for what you use over their generous limits.

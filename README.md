| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Configure

- Edit the config file `src/site.config.ts` for basic site meta data
- Update file `astro.config.ts` site property with your own domain.
- Replace & update files within the `/public` folder:
  - favicon.ico & other social icons
  - robots.txt - update the Sitemap url to your own domain
  - manifest.webmanifest
- Modify file `src/styles/global.css` with your own light and dark styles.
  - You can also modify the theme(s) for markdown code blocks generated by [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com). Pirate has both a dark (dracula) and light (github-light) theme, which can be found in `src/site.config.ts`. You can find more theme(s) and options [here](https://expressive-code.com/guides/themes/#available-themes).
- Edit social links in `src/components/SocialList.astro` to add/replace your media profile. Icons can be found @ [icones.js.org](https://icones.js.org/), per [Astro Icon's instructions](https://www.astroicon.dev/guides/customization/#find-an-icon-set).
- Create / edit posts for your blog within `src/content/post/` with .md/mdx file(s). See [below](#adding-posts) for more details.


## Adding posts

This theme utilises [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to organise Markdown and/or MDX files, as well as type-checking frontmatter with a schema -> `src/content/config.ts`.

Adding a post is as simple as adding your .md(x) files to the `src/content/post` folder, the filename of which will be used as the slug/url. The posts included with this template are there as an example of how to structure your frontmatter. Additionally, the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) has a detailed section on markdown pages.

### Frontmatter

| draft | This is an optional property as it is set to false by default in the schema. By adding true, the post will be filtered out of the production build in a number of places, inc. getAllPosts() calls, og-images, rss feeds, and generated page[s]. You can view an example in `src/content/post/draft-post.md` |


## Pagefind search

This integration brings a static search feature for searching blog posts. In its current form, pagefind only works once the site has been built. This theme adds a postbuild script that should be run after Astro has built the site. You can preview locally by running both build && postbuild.

Search results only includes blog posts. If you would like to include other/all your pages, remove/re-locate the attribute `data-pagefind-body` to the article tag found in `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro`.

It also allows you to filter posts by tags added in the frontmatter of blog posts. If you would rather remove this, remove the data attribute `data-pagefind-filter="tag"` from the link in `src/components/blog/Hero.astro`.

If you would rather not include this integration, simply remove the component `src/components/Search.astro`, and uninstall both `@pagefind/default-ui` & `pagefind` from package.json. You will also need to remove the postbuild script from here as well.



## Analytics

You may want to track the number of visitors you receive to your blog/website in order to understand trends and popular posts/pages you've created. There are a number of providers out there one could use, including web hosts such as [vercel](https://vercel.com/analytics), [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/), and [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/).

This theme/template doesn't include a specific solution due to there being a number of use cases and/or options which some people may or may not use.

You may be asked to included a snippet inside the **HEAD** tag of your website when setting it up, which can be found in `src/layouts/Base.astro`. Alternatively, you could add the snippet in `src/components/BaseHead.astro`.

## Deploy

[Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) has a great section and breakdown of how to deploy your own Astro site on various platforms and their idiosyncrasies.

By default the site will be built (see [Commands](#commands) section above) to a `/dist` directory.
